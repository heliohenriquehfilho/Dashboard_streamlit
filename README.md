## 🗂 **Dataset**

This project uses the [Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/mobile-device-usage-and-user-behavior-dataset) from Kaggle. The dataset includes:

- **700 user samples** with metrics like:
  - Screen-on time (hours/day)
  - App usage time
  - Battery drain
  - Data consumption

Each entry is categorized into one of five user behavior classes, ranging from light to extreme usage.
